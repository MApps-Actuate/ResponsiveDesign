Responsive Design
=================

The Responsive Design demo shows how iHub visualization can be made part of a responsive design framework, in this case bootstrap. Besides being able to rearrange themselves to the device/browser size via bootstrap, iHub's inherent ability to resize the visualizations to fill out the allocated space is also shown.

To install the demo, publish as an application to your iHub server from the BIRT Analytics Designer.
